omg-not-a-framework
===================

A collection of PHP snippets that I use and have used over the years that just make life simple for when you are not using a framework that has everything including the kitchen sink.


## output / printThis ##

If you get sick of adding _pre_ tags and other crap around your output because you just want to visualise that damn value, then this function will help.  Just type *pt($yourValue)* and it's taken care of.  

String value, Array or JSON Array no worries flat or multidimensional, bingo it all comes out on screen.  Need to include the output inside other output, too easy just change the echo value to return.
