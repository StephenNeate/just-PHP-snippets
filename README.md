just some PHP snippets
===================

A collection of PHP snippets (functions and classes) that I use and have used over the years that just make life simple for when you are not using a framework that has everything including the kitchen sink.  

Will slowly build to this list over time or if I feel aggravated and need to do something other than the daily grind.


## output / printThis ##

If you get sick of adding _pre_ tags and other crap around your output because you just want to visualise that damn value, then this function will help.  Just type *pt($yourValue)* and it's taken care of.  

String value, Array or JSON Array no worries flat or multidimensional, bingo it all comes out on screen.  Need to include the output inside other output, too easy just change the echo value to return.
